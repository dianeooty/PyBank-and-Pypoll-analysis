## General Information
- The PyBank project was to create a Python script that analyzes the dataset of a financial company.  The dataset reflected the profit and losses of the company over a period. The script must calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, net total amount of "Profits/Losses", the changes in "Profits/Losses" and the both the greatest increase and decrease for the entire period.  The results must print out to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
- The PyPoll project was to create a Python script that analyzes the outcome of an election dataset.  The dataset reflected the voterâ€™s ID, the candidate voted for and the counties.  From the dataset, the script must calculate the total amount of votes, a list of candidates who received votes, the percentage and number of votes for each candidate and the winner of the election.  The results must print out to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


## Technologies Used
- Visual Studio
- Python
- Excel

## Setup
You can find the complete datasets for both in the resource folders and the analysis text files in the analysis folders.


## Usage
To analyze the datasets for PyBank and PyPoll, please see scripts below.
